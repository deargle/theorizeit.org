<p>Team members at the Human Behavior Project completed a report for NIH that evaluated the <a href="https://www.gem-beta.org/Public/Home.aspx">GEM</a> (Grid-Enabled Measures Database) website for possible improvements. GEM is a tool for researchers to share and discover related research information. Evaluation focused on suggestions that would encourage users to share information about constructs and measures that will increase the ability to detect construct synonymy and similarity. More information about the goals of GEM can be found <a href="http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/BRP/gem.html">here</a>.</p>
