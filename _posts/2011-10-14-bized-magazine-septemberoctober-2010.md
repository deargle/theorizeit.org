<p><strong>Research Across Disciplines</strong></p>
<p>Three professors have received a $350,000 grant from the Science of Science and Innovation Policy program at the National Science Foundation. Kai Larsen and Jintae Lee, associate professors at the University of Colorado at Boulder's Leeds School of Business, will work with Eliot Rich, assistant professor of information technology management at the University at Albany in New York, to study how--and how well--research methodologies interact across disciplines. They are most interested in how increased specialization within research disciplines might complicate scholars' efforts to share knowledge.</p>
