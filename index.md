The Human Behavior Project (HBP) aims to integrate the behavioral sciences through natural language processing algorithms. 
The project is predicated on what we term the [Reverse Progress ](http://theorizeit.org/reverse-progress-problem-behavioral-sciences) of the Behavioral Sciences, and accomplished through 
the production of the [Internomological Network Search Engine](http://inn.colorado.edu/).

Current research on the project occurs in the form of extraction and automatic text analysis of variables, constructs and 
textual evidence from top behavioral journals across the disciplines of Psychology, Education, Business, Nursing, and Healthcare. 
Recent National Science Foundation funding allowed the expansion of the project into the Management, Marketing, Information Systems, 
and Communication disciplines along with the research area of Science and Innovation Policy.
