A central goal of behavioral medicine is the creation of evidence-based interventions for promoting behavior change. Scientific knowledge about behavior change could be more effectively accumulated using &quot;ontologies.&quot; In information science, an ontology is a systematic method for articulating a &quot;controlled vocabulary&quot; of agreed-upon terms and their inter-relationships. It involves three core elements: (1) a controlled vocabulary specifying and defining existing classes; (2) specification of the inter-relationships between classes; and (3) codification in a computer-readable format to enable knowledge generation, organization, reuse, integration, and analysis. This paper introduces ontologies, provides a review of current efforts to create ontologies related to behavior change interventions and suggests future work.

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The problem of detecting whether two behavioral constructs reference the same real world phenomenon has existed for over 100 years; we term discordant naming of constructs the Construct Identity Fallacy (CIF). We designed and evaluated the Construct Identity Detector (CID), the first tool with large-scale construct identity detection properties and the first tool that does not require respondent data. Through the adaptation and combination of different natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, six designs were created and evaluated against human expert decisions. All six designs were found capable of detecting construct identity, and a design combining two existing algorithms significantly outperformed the other approaches. A set of follow-up studies suggests the tool is valuable as a supplement to expert efforts in literature review and meta-analysis. Beyond Design Science contributions, this article has important implications related to the taxonomic structure of social- and behavioral-science constructs, for the jingle and jangle fallacy, the core of the Information Systems (IS) nomological network, and the inaccessibility of social and behavioral science knowledge. In sum, CID represents an important, albeit tentative, step towards discipline-wide identification of construct identities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Research" /><category term="Article" /><summary type="html">Kai R.
